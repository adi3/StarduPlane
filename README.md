# Stanford ArduPilot Project

This is a fork of the ArduPilot project to expose state and control variables for building custom autopilot control laws for Stanford AA241X.

You can find lots of development information at the [ArduPilot development site](http://dev.ardupilot.com)


## Getting this source to your machine

Two options:

1. You can download the source using the "ZIP" button at the top
of the github page.  

2. You can make a clone using git:

```
git clone git://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot.git
```

The second option is prefered to allow you to pull future updates of the base code.


## Building

To build this source you will need a Windows operating system with the custom Arduino development environment available.  Instructions on setting this up can be found here -- [Dev.Ardupilot] (http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-ardupilot-with-arduino-windows/)
